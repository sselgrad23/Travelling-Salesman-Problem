# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
These are implementations of the Ant Algorithm, a greedy algorithm, and a brute force method for solving the travelling salesman problem I wrote back in 2017 to 2018. The report can be found [here.](https://github.com/sselgrad23/Travelling-Salesman-Problem/blob/34f4115ccb6ef488c99d3470525cf692ffa9c6aa/Travelling%20Salesman%20Problem%20Report.pdf)
